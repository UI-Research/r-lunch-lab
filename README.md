# R Lunch Lab

R Lunch Labs are weekly, hands-on trainings hosted by the Urban Institute R Users Group for R users of all skill levels and soon-to-be R users. Each meeting begins with a 10-15 minute quick tip. Afterwards, attendees break into small groups and work on a range of topics including introduction to R, data management and plotting, mapping, machine learning, and more.
